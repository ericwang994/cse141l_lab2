Programs 1 & 2 work like a charm
However, Program 3 we weren't able to crack the code.
Most likely a allocation in memory error but don't have enough time to debug.
The hardest challenge in implementing the ISA was trying to use buggy starter code & testbenches.
We gave our testbenches modifications so that it could actually run, like actually connecting the 
reset reg to the dut CPU, and giving the CPU a required reset initialization of the PC.
The testbench_all doesn't work as we didn't have the time to figure out programs already tested.
